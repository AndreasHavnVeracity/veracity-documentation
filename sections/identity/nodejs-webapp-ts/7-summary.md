# 7. Summary
**This tutorial is deprecated, and we advise against following it. Still, it can give you an overview of how to build a Node JS application with Veracity, but you will need to update yourself with current information (for example, by talking to the Application Team Network).**
[Previous - 6. Transpiling for production](6-transpiling-for-production.md)

Throughout this tutorial we have learned how to:

- set up a developer environment with Visual Studio Code.
- set up an express application.
- authenticate with Veracity using the helper library.
- call Veracity APIs
- Transpile our code so that it can be run on a production server.

Hopefully you have found this tutorial useful. If you have ideas for improvements, run into problems or issues or simply wish to contribute, head over to our GitHub page.
