Below, youâ€™ll find all the information and resources you need to navigate this change smoothly.

## What's Happening?

We are phasing out Veracity Data Fabric/My Data and transitioning to Veracity Data Workbench, a more powerful and feature-rich platform designed to enhance your data management experience. This page provides everything you need to know to prepare for this transition.

## Important Dates:

* Migration Deadline: 31 December 2024

## Actions required for Data Managers :
1. Plan Your Migration: To avoid disruptions in your data management activities, we strongly recommend that you start planning your migration process now, with an aim of completing it by the end of Q3 2024.
2. Inform Your Users: As a Data Manager, it is your responsibility to communicate these changes to the users of your data. Ensure they are aware of the intended timeline and have access to the necessary resources.
