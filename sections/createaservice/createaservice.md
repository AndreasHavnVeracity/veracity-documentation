# Create a digital service in Veracity

Digital services in Veracity come in many different flavors. You may choose to use a few or a wide range of platform capabilities in your service. Independently of what platform services you want to take advantage of, there are a few mandatory steps.


## What is a project

All services in Veracity needs to be part of a project in the Provider Hub, or My Projects, located on the menu bar in Developer.veracity.com. From there, resources like Veracity Identity can be provisioned self-service.

A project in Veracity Provider Hub is what holds all resources related to your product. You can add collaborators into a Project, and assign access rights to these collaborators. You would typically have one project for every product. E.g., the DNV GL product <i>DNVGL Oil and Gas Standards and Recommended Practices</i>, would usually have one project called <i>DNVGL Oil and Gas Standards and Recommended Practices</i>.

Inside a project, you can create a resource. A resource can be application credentials for using Veracity Identity in your service or any other platform capabilities. You can think of a project as a resource group, with some user management.


## What is a resource
A resource is any platform capability that needs provisioning for your project to use it. An example of such a resource is Application credentials, which is required in order to integrate with the Veracity Identity.

Some of the resources you can provision self-service, some are default part of a project, and some are configured by Veracity Onboarding before your product is released to production on Veracity. e.g. Marketplace is provisioned by Veracity Onboarding and will be done in close collaboration with you.

## Next steps
To create your first service, you need to do two things. First, sign up to the developer program from Developer.veracity.com if you have not done so yet, and create a new project with an application credential under <i>My projects</i>.

Second, you can create your service from scratch using any language you want, using the documentation found under each platform service, or you can try our Veracity Application Generator. Read More about the generator in the next section.
