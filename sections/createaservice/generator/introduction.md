# Veracity application generator 
To make life easy for you, we in Veracity have created a Yeoman generator to get you started with your applications. The generator requires NodeJs to be installed to run. You may pick your language of choice for the Veracity application in the generator.

This section is divided into four separate sections
1 - Set up your development environment
2 - Install the Veracity application generator
3 - NodeJS application instructions
4 - .Net application instructions

This document was updated after release: 2.0.1
