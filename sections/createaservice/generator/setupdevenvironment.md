# Set up your dev environment

To set up your dev environment to run the Veracity application generator, you first need to install Node on your computer. If NodeJs is not installed, go to [Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and get the latest stable version. Node is only needed in order to run the generator, and you will need this independently of if you will program in Node or another language.

When you are all done, you may go ahead and install the Veracity application generator by following the instructions in the next section.
