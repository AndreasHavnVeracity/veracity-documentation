Biofuels and their blends require additional parameter to be reported. Details on how to report those parameters in the Bunker Report are given in [this document](https://veracitycdnprod.blob.core.windows.net/developer/veracitystatic/ovd/OVD%20Bunker%20Report%20-%20details.pdf). 

Please also see the document [How to report fuel consumption and ROBs using the BDN based method](https://veracitycdnprod.blob.core.windows.net/developer/veracitystatic/ovd/BDN%20based%20reporting%20in%20OVD.pdf).
