As per beginning of year 2024, calculations of emissions for biofuels are not fully implemented in Veracity by DNV due to late changes in the Regulations. Implementation is expected to be released in Q2 2024 and will be in line with [OVD Bunker Report – details document](https://veracitycdnprod.blob.core.windows.net/developer/veracitystatic/ovd/OVD%20Bunker%20Report%20-%20details.pdf).
In the meantime, it is still possible to report biofuels and get accurate statements (with corresponding deduction of emissions where applicable) for all regulations using the interim procedure described in [this document](https://veracitycdnprod.blob.core.windows.net/developer/veracitystatic/ovd/How%20to%20report%20biofuels%20for%20verification%20-%20interim%20solution.pdf).
