DNV detects port-of-call as per MRV & EU ETS regulations automatically based on the reported OVD Log Abstract data. Therefore, OVD will calculate 'voyage legs' based on Arrival and Departure events. For certain ship types an explicit reporting for non-port-of-call port stays is required and is described[in this document](https://veracitycdnprod.blob.core.windows.net/developer/veracitystatic/ovd/How%20to%20report%20port%20calls.pdf).
