Generally speaking, the OVD data one uses for DNV’s MRV and DCS verification services is the same as used for Emissions Connect. There are only a few additional requirements which are described [in this document](https://veracitycdnprod.blob.core.windows.net/developer/veracitystatic/ovd/How%20to%20report%20for%20DNV%E2%80%99s%20Emissions%20Connect%20service.pdf).
