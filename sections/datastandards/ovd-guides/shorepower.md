Electricity received from ashore, either in ports which provide onshore power supply or while vessel is in dry dock, should be reported in the OVD. Reporting of electricity delivered to the ship is mandatory and beneficial for the FuelEU Maritime GHG compliance.

[This document](https://veracitycdnprod.blob.core.windows.net/developer/veracitystatic/ovd/How%20to%20report%20Onshore%20Power%20Supply.pdf) describes how the reporting shall be done in the OVD Log Abstract.
