# How to report contract change for Emissions Connect
EU ETS is following the berth-to-berth concept introduces by EU and IMO. Hence, the total emissions and finally the EUAs are applied to voyages between berths of different ports and at berth of the same port.

However, in the commercial setting it might be wanted to get the emissions and the EUAs verified for different periods, e.g., the charter period. How to report a break of voyages ant their associated emissions and EUAs is described [in this document](http://standard.no/).
