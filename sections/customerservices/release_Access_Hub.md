# Veracity Access Hub Release

Read this page to learn what has changed in the Veracity Access Hub. 

## New Features

This section covers new features.

### New admin roles

We have implemented new admin roles so that customers can assign users different admin roles depending on how many permissions they want to grant them. See the new roles below.

#### New User Admin role
We have implemented a new User Admin role. A User Admin can add, approve, and remove users within a tenant.

#### New Group Admin role
We have implemented a new Group Admin role. A Group Admin can add or remove users from a group they manage within a tenant.

#### New Application Admin role
We have implemented a new Application Admin role. An Application Admin can view, add, and delete licenses for users and groups to the application. They can also change application settings such as automatic license assignment.

### New page for managing User Admins
We have created a new page that lists all User Admins. On this page, Super Admins can:
* Search for User Admins by typing their name or email in the search box.
* Add and delete User Admins by email address or name. Note that Super Admins can add multiple user admins at once and send invitations to users without Veracity accounts.

### New page for managing Group Admins
We have created a new page which lists all Group Admins. On this page, Super Admins can:
* Search for Group Admins by typing their name or email in the search box.
* Add and delete Group Admins.
* Add simultaneously multiple Group Admins from a searchable and prefilled list of tenant members.

### New page for managing Application Admins
We have created a new page that lists all Application Admins. On this page, Super Admins can:
* Add and delete Application Admins for Veracity-managed applications. Note that Super Admins cannot add or delete Application Admins for other types of applications.
* Add simultaneously multiple Application Admins from a list of tenant members.
