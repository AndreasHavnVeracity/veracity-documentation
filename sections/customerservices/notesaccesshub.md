# Release notes for Veracity Access Hub  

Below are the latest updates and improvements to Veracity Access Hub.  

## March 2025 - New admin roles and UI enhancements  

We've introduced new admin roles to provide more flexible and granular access management. Additionally, we’ve improved the user interface based on user feedback.  

### New features  

#### New admin roles  
We have added the following admin roles to help you delegate responsibilities more effectively:  

- **User Admin** – Manages users within the tenant, including adding, approving, and removing users.  
- **Application Admin** – Manages assigned applications, including user access and configuration.  
- **Group admin** – Manages user groups assigned to them by a tenant admin.  

These roles ensure more structured delegation of responsibilities. For details, see [the documentation.](accesshub.md) 

#### New Admins page  
Tenant Admins can now manage all admin roles in the newly added **Admins** page. This centralizes administrative settings, making role assignments more streamlined.  

### Changes to existing features  

#### UI enhancements  
We've updated the UI to reflect the new admin roles and improved the text throughout the interface for better clarity and usability.  

#### Relocated admin settings  
Admin role management settings have been moved from the **Settings** page to the new **Admins** page. Tenant admins can now manage all admin roles in one dedicated location.
