You can integrate APIs with Data Workbench. To do so, you need a service account.

2. In the left sidebar, select **Add account**. 
3. Enter the name for the account.
4. Select **Add**. 

After that, your account will be created, and you will get the values for the service account secret, ID, and API key. You will need them to [authenticate API calls](authentication.md).

**Note that** you will see the service account secret only once. Copy it and store it securely.
