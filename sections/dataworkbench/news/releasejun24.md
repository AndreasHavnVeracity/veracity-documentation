# June 2024 release

Read this page to learn what has changed in Veracity Data Workbench with the June 2024 release. 

This release adds the **Analytics page** and lets you upload Python scripts to analyze your data sets. However, if you don't see the Analytics page in your workspace, it means it's not included in your subscription.

However, if you have only reader access to this page, you can:
* See scripts.
* Download scripts.

### Improved navigation with breadcrumbs
We have added breadcrumbs in many parts of the UI to improve navigation.
