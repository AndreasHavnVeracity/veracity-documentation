# April 2023 second release

Release date: April 2023

Read this page to learn what has changed in Veracity Data Workbench with the second April 2023 release. The focus of this release was on making your periodic reporting easier.

## Changes in existing features

### Improved sorting
Now, you can sort (ascending and descending) some data columns. The columns you can sort depend on your data schema and on your data source.

### Improved filtering
* Now, you can filter from a date, to a date, and in a range (between dates). Also, you can manually input the date.
* Now, when you search for a filter from a list, you are offered live suggestions when you type the filter's name.

### Standardized filters
* Now, filters are improved based on user feedback, resulting in a more user-friendly experience. For example, you can add and remove filters. Also, unused filters are hidden to avoid clutter.
* Previously, List and ListSelectOne(Year) filters differed in behaviour from other filters. Now, they behave like other filters.

### Improved calendar
* Now, the calendar is more user-friendly as it provides hints and adds some missing information required by Data Workbench. Because of that, you just need to provide the information required by the data sets you are filtering.
