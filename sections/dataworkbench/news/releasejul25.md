# July 2025 release

Read this page to learn what has changed in Veracity Data Workbench with the July 2025 release. 

## New features 
This section covers new features. 

### Better support for different connector types
Connectors are now grouped more clearly based on their function. You'll see partner integrations and quick actions organized into separate sections on the **Connectors** page, helping you navigate more easily. 

### Improved connector search
It is now easier to find the connector you're looking for. We have improved the search function on the **Connectors** page to provide faster and more relevant results. 

### Updated connector layout 
The **Connectors** page now opens with all sections expanded by default. This makes it quicker to view available connectors without extra clicks. When you search or reset your search, the sections remain expanded. 

## Changes in existing features
This section covers changes in existing features. 

### Refreshed connector descriptions and tooltips
Some texts and tooltips on the **Connectors** page have been updated to provide clearer explanations. 

### Cleaner tables in file storage and member views
We have simplified how some tables look: 
- File sizes now appear without unnecessary decimals. 
- In the member list, copy email with one click instead of two as before.
- File listings now show the last modified date instead of the created date. 

## Bugs fixed 
This section covers resolved bugs. 

### Guest banner display issue
A guest banner was sometimes shown incorrectly when navigating to the **Member** page. This has now been fixed. 

### Connector sorting issue
Connectors were not always shown in the correct order. They now display as expected. 

### File sharing access 
We fixed an issue where files or folders could appear shareable even when they were not actually shared with you.
