Release date: January 2023

Read this page to learn what has changed in Veracity Data Workbench with the January 2023 release.

## New features

This section covers new features:
* [Guest access](#guest-access)
* [Revoke data set access](#revoke-data-set-access)
* [Upload data sets from CSV files](#upload-data-sets-from-csv-files)

### Guest access
Now, you can share data sets with users that are not part of any workspace or tenant. The users are notified by email and can access the data sets by the link in the notification message or by going from the **Data catalogue** to **Shared with me** tab.
The guest users have reader access meaning they cannot edit data sets.

### Revoke data set access
Now, you can revoke user's access to a data set, and they are notified about that by email. For details, [see the documentation](../dataworkbench.md).

### Upload data sets from CSV files
Now, when in the **Data catalogue** tab, you can use the **Upload data set** button (in the top right corner) to upload a CSV file and have it converted into a data set. 

Note that:
* The file size limit is 500 MB.
* The only supported delimiter is comma.
* The conversion can take up to five minutes.

## Changes in existing features

This section covers changes in existing features:
* [Shared with me tab](#shared-with-me-tab)
* [Share data sets without expiration date](#share-data-sets-without-expiration-date)

### Shared with me tab
Now, in the "Data catalogue", there is a new tab called "Shared with me". The tab shows all the data sets that have been shared with you.

### Share data sets without expiration date
Previously, when sharing a data set, you had to decide on the expiration date for the share. Now, data sets are shared for unlimited time.
