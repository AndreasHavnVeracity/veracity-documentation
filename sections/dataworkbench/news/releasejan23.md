## New features

This section covers new features:

### Guest access
Now, you can share data sets with users that are not part of your workspace. The users are notified by email and can access the data sets by the link in the notification message or by going from the **Data catalogue** to **Shared with me** tab.
The guest users can use the "Info" and "Filter" action buttons, but they cannot edit data sets.

### Revoke data set access
Now, you can revoke user's access to a data set, and they are notified about that by email. For details, [see the documentation](../dataworkbench.md#to-revoke-access-to-a-data-set).
