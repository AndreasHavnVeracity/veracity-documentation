# May 2023 release

Release date: May 2023

Read this page to learn what has changed in Veracity Data Workbench with the second release in May 2023.

## New features

### Marketplace banner
Now, at the top of your Data Workbench workspace, you may see a banner that, when selected, redirects to the Marketplace page for Data Workbench. The banner shows only when relevant to you, for example, if you are a guest user that is not a member of any tenant or workspace.

### Endpoint for getting workspaces grouped by TenantID
Now, you can use the following endpoint to see all the workspaces you have access to grouped by TenantId. This should help you in sharing access to those workspaces.

Endpoint:

## Changes in existing features

### Redirect from guest access for tenant or workspace members
If you are a member of a Data Workbench tenant or workspace, when someone shares access to their tenant or workspace with you, you see this under the **Shared with me** tab and not in a [guest access](releasejan23.md). Thanks to this, the guest access does not limit you, and you can explore the shared tenant or workspace, keeping access to all Data Workbench features.

### API endpoints for improved filtering and sorting
