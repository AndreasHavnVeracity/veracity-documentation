Read this page to learn what has changed in Veracity Data Workbench with the December 2024 release.

## New features
This section covers new features.

### Schema management
Schema management is a feature that helps users view and manage the schemas.

To access the 'Schema management' feature, your workspace needs to have the 'SchemaManagement' subscription. Contact the Data Workbench team to add 'SchemaManagement' subscription to your workspace.
 
Once your workspace has a subscription, you will see the **Schema manager** button under the **Data catalogue** page to access it.
 
There are two types of schemas.
* **Predefined schemas** - public schemas that may be used by other workspaces.
* **Custom schemas** - workspaces created by your workspace.

In this schema management feature, we support:
* **View schemas** - to view schemas' details such as name, description, different schema versions, and their columns information.
* **Create schemas** - to create 'custom' workspace schema.
* **Edit schemas** - to edit schema info, edit existing versions' details, create a new schema version, or change the active version.

### View Schema subscriptions in Ledger
Now, you can view the Schema subscription events in Ledger.
