### Service accounts on Shared with list in data set details

### Column picker for shared data sets
Previously, you couldn't use a column picker for data sets that were shared with you. Now, you can do so, meaning you can toggle columns, select all, deselect all, and update the table. Note that it only lets you narrow down the data that was shared with you.
