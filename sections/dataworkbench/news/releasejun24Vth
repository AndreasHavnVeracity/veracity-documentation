# June 2024 fifth release

Read this page to learn what has changed in Veracity Data Workbench with the June 2024 fifth release.

## New features
This section covers new features.

### See Python execution script history
In [the first release in June 2024](releasejun24.md), we added the Analytics page to the workspaces that have a subscription for it. Initially, this page had only one tab called Python Execution, where users could execute Python scripts to perform analytics on their data sets.

Now, we have added another tab called **History of all executions**. In this tab, you can see the history of all Python scripts executed in your workspace.
