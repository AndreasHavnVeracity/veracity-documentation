## New features
This section covers new features.

### Connectors page

On your Home page, you see tiles with your connectors. Now, you can select the tile that says 'See all connectors' and navigate to a separate page with all your connectors. 

On the Connectors page, you see:
* A banner that links to the page on Solution Partners.
* Your connectors.
* Available connectors for your workspace and a search field to find more connectors.

When you click on a connector, you navigate to the page dedicated to this connector.

### Limit what columns can be saved in a data set
Now, when you are using a connector, the owner of the connector template can limit the boundary of what columns can be shown, saved and shared in the data sets. The limitations are implemented when a Data Workbench admin onboards the connector.
