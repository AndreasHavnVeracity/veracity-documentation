# December 2023 release

Read this page to learn what has changed in Veracity Data Workbench with the December 2023 release.

## New features
This section covers new features.

### Automated secure storing of the Body of Evidence data

We have implemented automation that shares Body of Evidence (BOE) items with their correct tenants and workspaces, where the data is kept in secure locations with appropriate access control. The shared data can serve as a backup and can be used for data transparency.

### New schemas and endpoint
For the MPP connector, we have made available the following data sets for Emission Connect customers:
* Period Statement CII
* Period Statement EU Allowances

This lets you browse for additional types of Statement of Compliance documents and download them.

## Changes in existing features
This section covers changes in existing features.

### Renamed the Statement of Compliance V1 schema
