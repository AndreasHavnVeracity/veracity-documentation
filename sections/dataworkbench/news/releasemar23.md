Read this page to learn what has changed in Veracity Data Workbench with the March 2023 release.

## Changes in existing features

This section covers changes in existing features.

### Order data set details column picker alphabetically
When seeing data set details, you can enable or disable some columns in the column picker. Now, the columns are ordered alphabetically, so that you can find what you are looking for easier and faster.

### Data set status now in activity log
Now, the activity log for your workspace shows changes in the share status (created, revoked, expired) for a data set.

### Workspace ID moved from meta data to relevant endpoints
Now, the meta data endpoint does not show 'workspaceId', because this information was added to the relevant API endpoints.
