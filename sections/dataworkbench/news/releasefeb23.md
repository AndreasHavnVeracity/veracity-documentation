## Changes in existing features

This section covers changes in existing features.

### Access to data sets for service accounts
Previously, a service account had access to all the data in a workspace. Now, you can select the data sets to be shared with the service account (**API integrations** > **Service accounts** > **Your service account** > **Access to data sets** > **Select data sets manually**). For details, [see the documentation](../apiintegrations.md).


### Contact email for service accounts
Now, for every service account, you must provide a contact email to its owner.
