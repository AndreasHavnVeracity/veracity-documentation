## Changes in existing features

This section covers changes in existing features.

### Order data set details column picker alphabetically
When seeing data set details, you can enable or disable some columns in the column picker. Now, the columns are ordered alphabetically, so that you can find what you are looking for easier and faster.

### Update sharing status for data sets
Previously, the activity log for your workspace was logging revoking access to a data set. Now, it logs any change to the sharing status for a data set, and it shows it as "Share status updated".
