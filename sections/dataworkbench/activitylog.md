# Activity logs
Data Workbench logs the following events:
* Changes to data sets (created, modified, deleted, shared or revoked access).
* Changes to connections (created, modified, deleted).
* Changes to workspaces (created, changed workspace description).
* Changes to workspace members (invited or deleted a member, changed member's role).
* Changes to service accounts for API sharing (created or deleted an account).

To see the activity log for a workspace, go to the **Workspace** tab. Then, under the bar with an arrow, go to the **Activity log** tab.

To see the activity log for data sets, go to the **Data Catalogue** tab. Then, under the bar with an arrow, go to the **Activity log** tab.

## Filters
Activity logs can be filtered by:
* Time range.
* Action performed.
* The user who has performed an action.

The filters are in the left corner of the window and above the logs. You can select any number of filters.

To clear a filter, select its name. In the dropdown that appears, select the **Clear filter** button.

To clear all the filters, in the right corner of the window, select **Clear all filters**.
