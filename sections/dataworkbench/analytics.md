# Analytics

Veracity provides a secure analytics environment powered by Azure Databricks, ensuring seamless and safe data processing. This integration allows you to leverage advanced analytics directly within Azure Databricks as part of the Veracity Data Platform ecosystem.

A Databricks workspace synchronizes data with the assosiated workspace in Veracity Data Workbench.

## Key features
- **Notebook development and execution:** Use Databricks notebooks to develop and run analytics. [Learn more](../dataplatform/analytics/analyticsdevelopment.md)
- **Output sharing through Power BI:** Save results as datasets or files and use Veracity Adapter for Power BI (VAP) to share reports with external stakeholders. [Learn more](../dataplatform/analytics/visualization.md)
- **Secure secret handling:** Use the Databricks secrets mechanism to safely manage sensitive data like API keys or credentials. [Learn more](../dataplatform/analytics/secretmgm.md)
