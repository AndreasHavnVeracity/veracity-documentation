# File storage in Data Catalogue
In your [Data Catalogue](datacatalogue.md), you can find a tab called **File storage**. There, you can upload files (pdf, png, txt, doc, excel, and more) to your Data Workbench workspace.

Note that File Storage is replacing Data Fabric. If you are migrating from Data Fabric, you can contact the [onboarding team](mailto:onboarding@veracity.com) for assistance.

## To go to File storage
1. In your workspace, go to **Data catalogue** page.
2. Select the **File storage** tab.

## To upload files
1. In the top right corner, select **Upload files**. You can upload multiple files at once.
2. Select the coloured circle with the file icon and select the files from your computer. Alternatively, drag and drop files.
3. Select **Upload**.

## Folders
In File storage, you can use folders to organize files. If you are a workspace admin, you can create folders.

To create a folder:
1. In the top right corner, select **Create folder**.
2. Name the folder.

2. Under **Set access level**, choose access level (read or read and write).
3. Optionally, under **Set access start**, choose a date from which this file or folder should be accessible.
