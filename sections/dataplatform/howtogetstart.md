# How to get started
In order to use the Veracity Dataplatform you need access to a tenant and at least one workspace. Onboarding team will setup a tenant and define tenant owner and workspace administrator. Contact support@veracity.com

## Testing/Piloting
You can get access to a pilot area for a limited time-period.

## Tenant and Workspace
Typically a tenant is customer specific. A tenant corresponds with a tenant in Veracity Tenant Management (VTM). 
A tenant will also be linked to Salesforce customer id.

## Way forward
Upload data to your workspace


## Client account 

See how to [create a client service principle that can access your workspace](https://developer.veracity.com/docs/section/dataworkbench/apimanagement)
