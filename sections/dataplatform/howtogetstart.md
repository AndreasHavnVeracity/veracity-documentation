# How to get started
In order to use the Veracity Dataplatform you need access to a tenant and at least one workspace. Onboarding team will setup a tenant and define tenant owner and workspace administrator. Contact support@veracity.com

## Testing/Piloting
You can get access to a pilot area for a limited time-period.

## Tenant and Workspace
Typically a tenant is customer specific. A tenant corresponds with a tenant in Veracity Tenant Management (VTM). 
A tenant will also be linked to Salesforce customer id.

If your service is multi-tenant, the tenants to support should be reflected in DWB as well. Within each tenant you need at least one workspace.

Workspaces can be created using Dataworkbench api. This can only be done by tenant admin.

## Client account 

See how to [create a client service principle that can access your workspace](https://developer.veracity.com/docs/section/dataworkbench/apimanagement)
