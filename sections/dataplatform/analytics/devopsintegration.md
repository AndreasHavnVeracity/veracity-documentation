# Connect databricks to your devops
Databricks Repos provides repository-level integration with Git providers. You can develop code in an Azure Databricks notebook and sync it with a remote Git repository.

For more information about best practices for code development using Databricks Repos, [see Best practices for integrating Databricks Repos with CI/CD workflows.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/repos/#best-practices)

Personal Access Tokens (PATs) are a convenient way to access services like Azure Databricks or Azure DevOps without logging in with your password. A more secure alternative is to access Azure DevOps resources using a Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) access token.
