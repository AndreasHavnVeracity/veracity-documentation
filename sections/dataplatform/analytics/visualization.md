However, these results can not be shared with users outside dnv.

## Visualization using Power BI from Dataworkbench

Analytics can write their output(s) to data workbench filestorage or as a dataset.
Power BI can connect to a dataset or to a file in filestoage and reports can be developed.
Veracity Adapter for PowerBI (VAP) can be used to distribute the report to the external customers.
