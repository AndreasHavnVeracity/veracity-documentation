# Visualize analytic results

## Visualization in Databricks
Databricks has built-in support for charts and visualizations in both Databricks SQL and in notebooks.

However, these results can not be shared with users outside dnv.

## Visualization using Power BI from Dataworkbench

Analytics can write their output(s) to data workbench filestorage or as a dataset.
Power BI can connect to a dataset or to a file in filestoage and reports can be developed.
Veracity Adapter for PowerBI (VAP) can be used to distribute the report to the external customers.

You can see the new dataset in the same workspace you executed the script of Dataworkbench UI.
