# Azure data Lake

Azure Data Lake StorageÂ is a cloud-based, enterprise data lake solution. We are currently using ADLS Gen2.

It combines the power of a Hadoop compatible file system with integrated hierarchical namespace with the massive scale and economy of Azure Blob Storage to help speed your transition from proof of concept to production.
Is fully integrated with the Azure Blob Storage platform; Every Blob Storage capability (Azure Active Directory Integration, At Rest Encryption, High-availability and disaster recovery, Automated Lifecycle Policy Management, Storage Account Firewalls, etc.) can be used by Azure Data Lake Storage.
