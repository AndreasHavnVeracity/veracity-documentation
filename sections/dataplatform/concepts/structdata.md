# Structured and unstructured data
Structured data has a predefined data model and is formatted to a set data structure before being placed in data storage (using schema), whereas unstructured data is stored in its native format and not processed until it is used 

## Structured data
Veracity dataplatform datasets are structured data and can be uploaded/ingested using a pre-defined schema or allow the ingest process to create a schema based on the columns in the CSV file.

## Schema
A schema defines the model for the data.

## Unstructured data
When uploading files to file storage, there is no schema validation and the file is stored in its native format and can be of any file type.
