# Storage

All data (structured and unstructred) is stored in Azure Data Lake.

## Scaling

Data Lake enables you to capture data of any size, type, and ingestion speed in one single place for operational and exploratory analytics. There is no limit to the amount of data you can store in a Data Lake Store account. Your Data Lake Store can store trillions of files where a single file can be greater than a petabyte in size.

It doesn't impose any limits on account sizes, file sizes, or the amount of data that can be stored in the data lake. Individual files can have sizes that range from a few kilobytes (KBs) to a few petabytes (PBs)

With Azure Data Lake Store you can analyze all of its data in a single place with no artificial constraints.

## Retention

It is possible to specify number of days a file will be available in storage. Default is forever.
