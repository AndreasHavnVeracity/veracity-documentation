# Frequently Asked Questions 

|Question| Answer |
|--|--|
| What is the difference between IoT Hub and Event Hub, which should I choose? | It depends. Both are highly scalable. IoT Hub implements a daily message quota, whereas Event Hub implements bandwidth throttling. Event Hub supports HTTPS, AQMP and Kafka. IoT Hub supports HTTPS, AQMP and MQTT. Both are widely supported in SDKs and third party libraries and products.|
| I have ingested some poor quality data, or duplicate data that I want to  clean up. How do I do this? | You can't. We capture and store what is sent, as RAW data. The time-series data storage is append only and cannot be modified. The preparation step for your analytics should handle and filter for these scenarios. Alternatively you can talk to us about implementing a customized medallion architecture for your data lake. Also, please do not send test data to your production environment. Please contact us if you need additional datasets for testing purposes. |
| I have comprised my connection string / key. How can I generate a replacement?  | Contact support. They can revoke the key and provide you with a replacement.|
| I am getting a Throttling Exception when sending data to my Event Hub. What does this mean?|You are most likely experiencing a temporary spike in traffic which exceeds your throughput limitation (measured in messages/second or MB/second). Either try again later or contact us to upgrade your subscription.  It is customer responsibility to ensure the sending solution is robust enough to handle this scenario and buffer/retry the data until the data is successfully sent. 
| I am getting a Throttling Exception when sending data to my IoT Hub. What does this mean? | You have exceeded your daily message quota. Either try again later, or contact us to upgrade your subscription. It is customer responsibility to ensure the sending solution is robust enough to handle this scenario and buffer/retry the data until the quota is renewed the next day. | | |
|  How many streaming datasets do I need?| It depends. We recommend 1 per schema, per workspace, per region. It is possible to ingest from multiple producers in to a single dataset using IoT Hub as long as they all send using the same schema. For example, if you have a fleet of 10 vessels, all 10 could stream to the same dataset using their own connection string. The dataset can then be filtered/shared as required. The sender should provide AssetId or other data to be able to distingush between the different sources of data.|
| I don't like your suggested schema. Can I use my own? | We highly recommend using our standard schemas for maximum compatibility with our services. However, yes, it is possible to use a customized schema. There are some limitations, for example the schema must have a Timestamp column (called "Timestamp", of type DateTime). Please contact us to discuss your specific requirements. |
| I have ingested a lot of data which I now would like to analyze, do some machine learning and then visualize. How can I get started? | Please contact Derek, he will be happy to explain our roadmap and answer any questions or concerns you may have. |
| It is difficult to view, query and page through my dataset in the web portal. Who's idea was this?  |  Yes, we know already. The tooling in the web portal will be improved  based on customer feedback. |
| What type of query performance can I expect?| The performance profile of data lake is different from what can be expected from e.g. SQL database. You should expect queries to take between 5 and 30 seconds depending on query complexity and volume of data being scanned. You should always filter on timestamp. If the queries become slower as the volume of data is growing, it can be that some housekeeping is needed in your datalake to ensure good performance. Please contact support for assistance. |
| What is the precision of timestamp supported?  | We can ingest and store nano-second precision (e.g. 2024-06-10T09:10:34.473977Z). Note that BYOD file upload only supports milli-second precision, streaming supports nano-second precision |
