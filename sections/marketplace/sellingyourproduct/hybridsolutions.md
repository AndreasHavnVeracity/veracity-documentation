# Combinations
In both "One-column" and "Side-by-side" display options you can configure a combination of variants of your product. 
You can for example combine a free plan above a paid plan, or even add an extra variant of plan for users that have special needs, and show a “contact provider” button (1). You can show a plan with customized button (2) – which can link to an external website.
We have many possibilities to assecondate your pricing and selling needs.
Contact us in case you need more guidance for more complex configuration of pricing.
