# Customer Onboarding
A smooth onboarding process is essential for customer retention. Developers together with designers and product managers should design intuitive onboarding flows that guide users through initial setup and configuration, making the first interaction with the product as straightforward as possible.

## Product Delivery Integration
Automated delivery systems should be robust, facilitating instant product provisioning post-purchase. VTM can be utilized to manage access permissions for these automated services.

## Customer Onboarding with VTM
The onboarding process should be intuitive, guiding users through setup and configuration. VTM aids in this by managing user access to applications and services after a purchase. In Access hub (self-service tool for customers), the admin of a subscription or application can easily invite users and manage different company accounts.

## VTM API Usage
The API allows for authentication, authorization, and subscription checks, supporting various access control models for different applications.
