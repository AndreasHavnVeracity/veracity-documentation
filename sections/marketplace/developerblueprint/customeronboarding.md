# Customer Onboarding
A smooth onboarding process is essential for customer retention. Developers together with designers and product managers should design intuitive onboarding flows that guide users through initial setup and configuration, making the first interaction with the product as straightforward as possible.

## VTM Overview
Veracity Tenant Management (VTM) can manage access permissions for Veracity applications and services, ensuring smooth integration with other systems. It also includes an API for managing tenants (company accounts), company profiles, and groups.

## Product Delivery Integration
Automated delivery systems should be robust, facilitating instant product provisioning post-purchase. VTM can be utilized to manage access permissions for these automated services.

## Customer Onboarding with VTM
The onboarding process should be intuitive, guiding users through setup and configuration. VTM aids in this by managing user access to applications and services after a purchase. In Access hub (self-service tool for customers), the admin of a subscription or application can easily invite users and manage different company accounts.

## VTM API Usage
The API allows for authentication, authorization, and subscription checks, supporting various access control models for different applications.

## Subscription Management

## Subscription Renewal
Veracity marketplace offers a self-service solution for renewal, that simplifies the process for both you and your customers. We have set up a system of automatic emails to remind the users about upcoming renewals, updating PO numbers or updating card details in “My subscription” section. Subscriptions are considered to be evergreen, meaning they will be automatically renewed until the customer cancels.

## Encouraging Upgrades
Developers should consider in-app prompts and notifications that encourage users to explore higher tiers, showcasing the additional value and features that come with an upgrade.

## Subscription Management
A seamless subscription management system is vital for maintaining a steady revenue stream. Developers should build in-app reminders for subscription renewals and implement a straightforward process for users to manage their subscriptions.

## Access Termination
For non-renewals, developers must ensure that the product can revoke access appropriately. This involves creating a system that can handle subscription status changes and access rights efficiently. The overview in My subscription can also help users administrate and cancel their subscription.

## Conclusion
As a developer, your contribution to the product’s journey from concept to market is invaluable. By considering these key areas, you can ensure that your product not only meets technical excellence but also aligns with business strategies and provides a compelling user experience. The marketplace awaits your innovation—code wisely and make your mark.
