# Supporting Communications

## Trial Support
Users may need support during both trial phases and active subscriptions. It’s essential for developers to incorporate built-in support features within the product. These can include in-app guidance, chatbots, or direct links to customer service. Coordination with the support team, or a dedicated customer success representative if available, is crucial in determining these integrations. Given that Veracity already has well-established support channels, it’s advisable to first assess what can feasibly be provided through the application itself.

## Support After Trial or Purchase of Active Subscriptions

### Onboarding Assistance
- Guide users during trials to explore all features.
- Provide tutorials and tooltips.

### Responsive Customer Support
- Address queries promptly via chat or email.
- Offer self-help resources (knowledge base, FAQs).

## Post-Purchase Engagement
Automated post-purchase communications can drive user engagement and product adoption. Developers, together with marketing and communication, can plan for systems that trigger helpful emails, offering tips, feature highlights, and success stories.

### Upselling
Strategically promote higher-tier plans or additional features to existing users.

### In-App Marketing
- Use banners, pop-ups, or notifications to highlight premium features.
- Personalize messages based on user behavior.

## Feature Unlocking for Different Tiers

### Tier-Specific Features
- Define features available at each pricing tier.
- Grey out higher-tier features in lower-tier versions.

### Upgrade Prompts
- Prompt users to upgrade when accessing locked features.
- Explain benefits (for example, enhanced productivity).

## Renewal Process Support

### Using VTM (Veracity Marketplace)
- Encourage self-service renewal.
- Highlight convenience.

### Access Removal on Termination
- If not managed in VTM:
  - Disable features immediately upon cancellation.
  - Communicate impact clearly.

### Renewal Reminders

Ensuring customer success is paramount. Developers, together with designers, should contribute by planning customer follow-ups, embedded satisfaction surveys, and providing personalized support options within the product. This might need to be decided with the Product Manager and according to CX principles and strategy
