## Subscription Renewal
Veracity marketplace offers a self-service solution for renewal, that simplifies the process for both you and your customers. We have set up a system of automatic emails to remind the users about upcoming renewals, updating PO numbers or updating card details in “My subscription” section. Subscriptions are considered to be evergreen, meaning they will be automatically renewed until the customer cancels.
