# Trial Versions and Freemium Models

## Trial Implementation
Offering trial versions or freemium models can be a strategic move to attract potential customers. Developers need to plan the technical implementation of these models, ensuring that limitations on features or usage are built into the product without compromising the user experience. <a href="https://developer.veracity.com/docs/section/marketplace/sellingyourproduct/paidservices#offering-trials"> Read more</a>

## Demo Version
Consider providing a demo version of your software. This version grants users access to limited features, allowing them to explore the product’s functionality without committing to a purchase.

## Full Version with Time Limit
Alternatively, you could offer a full version of your product but restrict its usage within a specified time frame.

## Time-Based Trial
Set a fixed trial duration (for example, 30 days). Users can use all features during this period. After the trial period, the user needs to purchase the product. It needs to be clearly communicated that users won't have access anymore unless they purchase the product. This might be achieved through an access management system.

## Auto Conversion
Conversion of the trial to a full version subscription once trial time is finished. If the user doesn't cancel the trial, it will convert to the subscription automatically. This is not yet an offered capability but it’s on the Digital Commerce roadmap.

## Collaborate with Development Team
Discuss the technical implementation of these limitations with your product team. Ensure smooth transitions between trial and paid versions.

## Product Evaluation Strategies:
**Demo Videos:** Create engaging videos showcasing key features. Highlight how your product addresses pain points.
**Interactive Demos:** Develop web-based demos where users can interact with the software. Let them explore critical sections.
**Limited Access:** Allow users to experience essential features. For example:
**Dashboard:** Showcase real-time data visualization.
**User Interface:** Highlight intuitive navigation and usability.
**Core Functionality:** Demonstrate how the product solves specific problems.
**Case Studies/Testimonials:** Share success stories from existing users. Highlight tangible benefits.
**Free Workshops/Webinars:** Host educational sessions. Teach potential customers how to maximize value from your product.
