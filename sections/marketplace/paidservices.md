# Paid services

When planning to sell a service through Veracity Marketplace, you should have reached a high grade of maturity of your product and be ready for scalability. Get in touch with us if you want to know more about how "ready you are for selling digitally".

The following section gives an overview of the different pricing models you can use for your product.

## Standard price plan - horizontal visualization​

Standard pricing plans, with a horizontal view of the different pricing, are used when the provider needs to sell different  “Product variants”. A product variant describe different software solutions or packages of online software/APIs, data sets.​
Every variant has a name (1) and a description (2).​
When naming a specific variant, please try to be short and to the point in what the user gets (1). The description below the name of the variant, should help in specifying what it`s included in this package (2). ​

The pricing models rows (3) should be kept simple, and differentiate mainly by:​

* Prices ​

* Type of customers (eg. One users, 2-6 users, students, enterprise)​

* Subscription type (one-time, recurrent, yearly, monthly, support duration, etc.)​

## Comparable price plan - vertical visualization​

Comparable price plans are used when your need a more detailed explanation for the customer on what features or usage that is included in each product variant/price tier.​

When choosing this configuration you shall choose:​

* a name that is short and self explanatory (1);​

* different prices and subscription type (2);​

* a brief explanation at the top (we recommend this to be short, as features area should already cover most of the added value for your product) (3)​

* features and usage (4)​
​

Typical example of product features can be:​

Technical integrations available​

Sharing features​

Level of access, or rights (eg, Manager, viewer, etc.)​

Usage or consumption (eg, Mb/Tb data storage, number APIs) ​

​
As a rule when choosing this price plan, we suggest that you describe most of your product offerings in the descriptive paragraphs in the center of the page. When you come to text in the pricing plan, you shall try to summarize and be specific to what the customer gets.
