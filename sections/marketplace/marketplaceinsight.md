# Veracity Marketplace

If you have a service on Veracity Marketplace, you can access the Service Provider Report.

The report enables you to easily track the service/services you have on the Marketplace, giving you data analytics through an easy-to-use dashboard. 

With the Service Provider Report you're able to;

* Keep an overview of your service subscriptions (filtering by users, companies, and time)
* See the number of page views over time, or by country, for your Marketplace page 
* Monitor the sales you receive
* Monitor the licences sold vs usage (Beta version) 
* Monitor the user activity (Beta version)

Within our Veracity offerings, we also have a visualization of sales funnels in Google Data Studio.​
Inside these reports, you, as a provider, can see data from the general purchase/access journey and analyse how many users:​

* Visited your product page
* Contacted you through forms
* Started the checkout process or the get access to free product process;​
* Have been converted as part of a marketing campaign.​
​

In addition to this, we also have instrumented our pages with Hotjar, to provide you with more insights. ​

Hotjar is a user-behaviour-tracking tool that provides heatmaps (colour data visualization) on how users clicked, scrolled and moved around on your product page.​
Through recordings of visitor behaviour, it is possible to get an even deeper understanding of how users interact with your content. You can then use the aggregated statistics as a basis for testing assumptions and further design/content improvements.
