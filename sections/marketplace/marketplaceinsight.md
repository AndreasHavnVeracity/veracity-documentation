# Veracity Marketplace

If you have a service on Veracity Marketplace, you can access the Service Provider Report.

The report enables you to easily track the service/services you have on the Marketplace, giving you data analytics through an easy-to-use dashboard. 

With the Service Provider Report you're able to;

* Keep an overview of your service subscriptions (filtering by users, companies, and time)
* See the number of page views over time, or by country, for your Marketplace page 
* Monitor the sales you receive
* Monitor the licences sold vs usage (BETA version) 
* Monitor the user activity (BETA version)
