# Hybrid solutions

In both the standard horizontal and comparable vertical price plans, we offer the provider to configure a combination of variants of their product.​

​
As shown in the picture, we have 3 options for buttons configurations:​

* “Free access – button" (read more in ”Free services” article)​

* “Contact provider” or “Request quote” buttons.​
This last option should be used when the final client needs a customizable price for the package/service.  (read more in the ”leads generating service” article)​

* "Customize button" - can link to an external link

For comparable plans, we can display more detailed what the user gets as a free plan, compared to the paid plan.​ More specifications about time limitation for the free access can be added in the top description of the pricing plan/variant
