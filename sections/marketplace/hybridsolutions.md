# Combinations

In both the standard horizontal and comparable vertical price plans, we offer the provider to configure a combination of variants of their product.​

​
As shown in the picture, we have 3 options for buttons configurations:​

* “Free access button" (1). You can read more about this in the ["Free services"](freeservices.md) article

* “Contact provider” or “Request quote” buttons (2).​ This option should be used when the customer needs a customizable price for the package or service.  (read more in the ["leads generating service"](leadsgeneratingservices.md) article)​

* "Customized button" (3). These can link to an external website.

For comparable plans, we can display more detailed what the user gets as a free plan, compared to the paid plan.​ More specifications about time limitation for the free access can be added in the top description of the pricing plan/variant
