# Choosing your pricing model

Choosing the right pricing model for your product can be challenging. There are several pricing models relevant for digital offerings and we will introduce some of the most common ones;​

## Subscription model

Subscription is a well-known model and it’s easily understandable for customers. A subscription model can be set up to be just one single subscription in which case you might not capture the entire revenue potential of your service, so using a tiered subscription is advised. When making a tiered subscription you should not make too many tiers as this will make it difficult for the customers to select the one most suitable for them.​

Subscription models makes the cost predictable for the customer and the revenue predictable for you as the provider of the service.​

There are some additional mechanisms that can be considered when offering subscriptions; can you offer your customers a limited trial period? Why not let your customers try out what you can offer?​

Setting the price for the top tier offering for large enterprises could be difficult so you might keep this tier negotiable and making it possible for potential customers to request a price quote here.

## Consumption model (pay-as-you-go)​

The advantages of a consumption model is that the customers only pay for what they use. The cost for the customers will not be predictable and they will need some easily measurable consumption parameters to predict their cost.​

From the provider side this model makes it easy to ensure that the consumption price covers your cost. However sporadic use by customers may make revenue unpredictable.​

The price customers will pay is unpredictable and likewise the revenue of your service will be unpredictable​

Some might combine a subscription model with a consumption model where you have some included consumption in the subscription but charge overage use according to consumption.​

## Freemium model​

In a freemium model the entry level for the customer is low as the service is free. Usually the free version have limitations in functionality or some other limitation that should trigger the customers need to upgrade to a paid version.​

It is however not necessarily easy to convert free customers to paying customers and the cost of running a free service needs to be factored in when you calculate your bottom line for the service. You also have to consider carefully what you give away in the free version, to ensure that you don’t get too many users who are satisfied by staying on the free version.​
