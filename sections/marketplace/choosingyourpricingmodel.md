# Choosing your pricing model
Choosing the right pricing model for your product can be challenging, but this article will help you make the right choice. With Veracity, you can choose between four pricing models:
* Single subscription
* Tiered subscription
* Consumption model (pay-as-you-go)
* Freemium model

## Subscription models
Subscription models are well-known, easy for customers to understand and friendly to providers. Their main benefits are:
* Predictable cost for customers.
* Predictable revenue for you as the provider of the service.​

There are two ways you can set up a subscription model:
* Single subscription
* Tiered subscription

### Single subscription 
A single subscription means offering a single product or service with a fixed set of features at a fixed price. Avoid using this model if your resource costs vary significantly from user to user.

### Tiered subscription 
A tiered subscription means offering multiple packages with various features at different price points.
Do not make too many tiers because your customers will have a problem to choose the most suitable for them.​​
If you offer service for large enterprises, keep the top tier negotiable and leave the option to request a price quote.
You can add a free trial​ to show your prospective customers the value of your service and help them make an informed decision.
See the example below.

## Consumption model (pay-as-you-go)​
This model allows:
* Customers to pay for what they use.
* Providers to easily cover the costs.

Keep in mind that the costs will not be predictable if you decide on this model. Customers will need some measurable consumption parameters to evaluate their costs. For the provider, sporadic use by the customers may make revenue unpredictable.

If you want to have better control of revenue, you can combine a subscription price model with a consumption price model. Then, the user will have limited capacity included in their subscription, and will be charged for any extra consumption above this capacity.

## Freemium model​ 
In a freemium model, you make your service free for your customers.

The free version usually has limitations in functionality or some other limitation that make customers upgrade to a paid version.​

There are some disadvantages of this plan you need to consider:
* It might be difficult to convert free customers to paying customers.
* You need to factor in the cost of running a free service when calculating your bottom line for the service.
* You should carefully consider what you give away in the free version to ensure that you do not get too many users who are satisfied by staying on the free version.​
