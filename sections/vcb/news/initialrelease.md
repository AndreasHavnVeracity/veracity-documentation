# Initial release of Veracity Copilot Builder

Release date: 16 September 2024

We are thrilled to announce the initial release of Veracity Copilot Builder (VCB), a specialized toolkit designed to simplify the integration of chatbots (copilot projects) into .NET applications within the Veracity ecosystem. This tool focuses on a code-first approach, enabling the creation of more advanced solutions compared to low-code/no-code alternatives.

## New features
This section covers new features.

### Easy Plugin Creation
Build plugins (functions/tools) in .NET that seamlessly integrate with Veracity’s authorization system. Retrieve information or control functionalities within your application through these plugins.

### Knowledge Augmentation
Enhance your copilot’s knowledge by uploading relevant documents to a shared database. Control access to these documents, making them private to your copilot project or public for knowledge sharing across Veracity copilot projects.

### Code Interpreter
Allows the Large Language Model (LLM) to execute code when necessary. Particularly useful for requests involving math calculations or generating creative text formats based on data.

### Usage Tracking
Monitor copilot usage to identify potential abuse and gain insights. Track usage per user to prevent a single user from consuming excessive resources.

### Nested Agent Hierarchy
Organize your copilot’s functionalities using a hierarchical structure. Avoid context window limitations by grouping plugins by agent responsibility. Share your agent as a NuGet package for others to integrate into their applications.
