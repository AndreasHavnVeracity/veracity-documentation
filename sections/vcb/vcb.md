Veracity Copilot Builder is a specialized toolkit that simplifies integrating chatbots (copilot projects) into .NET applications within the Veracity ecosystem. It focuses on a code-first approach, enabling the creation of more advanced solutions compared to Microsoft Copilot Studio’s low-code/no-code solutions.

## Features
* **Easy Plugin Creation**: Build plugins (functions/tools) in .NET that seamlessly integrate with Veracity’s authorization system. These plugins can retrieve information or control functionalities within your application.
* **Knowledge Augmentation**: Enhance your copilot’s knowledge by uploading relevant documents to a shared database. You can control access to these documents, making them private to your copilot project or public for knowledge sharing across Veracity copilot projects.
* **Code Interpreter**: Lets the Large Language Model (LLM) execute code when necessary. This is particularly useful for requests involving math calculations or generating creative text formats based on data. 
* **Usage Tracking**: Monitor copilot usage to identify potential abuse and gain insights. You can track usage per user to prevent a single user from consuming excessive resources.
* **Nested Agent Hierarchy**: Organize your copilot’s functionalities using a hierarchical structure. This is helpful when your copilot has many plugins, as it avoids context window limitations. You can also share your agent as a NuGet package for others to integrate into their applications.

## Benefits for users
* **Reduced Complexity**: Simplifies the process of integrating chatbots into .NET applications.
* **Advanced Solutions**: Enables the creation of more powerful and versatile chatbots compared to low-code/no-code solutions.
* **Improved Security**: Provides granular control over access to knowledge documents through Veracity’s authorization system.
* **Enhanced Functionality**: Allows code execution for complex tasks and creative text generation.
* **Better Resource Management**: Enables usage tracking to identify potential abuse and optimize resource allocation.
* **Modular Design**: Supports a hierarchical agent structure for better organization and reusability.
