# Veracity IoT

Veracity dataplatform enables both stream and batch upload of sensor data. For more details of batch upload see, [ingest of structured data](https://developer.veracity.com/docs/section/dataplatform/storage/datasets) and for [continusous strema](https://developer.veracity.com/docs/section/dataplatform/storage/streaming)

Data Channel is a concept that represents virtual data transmission channels such as sensor-data or events. Data channels can be defined in Veracity Asset Models with its metadata such as unit, see more detail about [Veracity Asset Model](https://developer.veracity.com/docs/section/dataplatform/mms/mmsintroduction). Data channels can be ingested without asset model, but as asset model will enrich the data and provide better context.
