# Upload new data in Data Workbench and display it in report in VAP

To update a file in Data Workbench, ensure that the file you want to upload has the same name as the old one.

Overwrite the existing file in Data Workbench.

New data will be shown in the report in VAP when a scheduled refresh is set up or you trigger an on-demand refresh from VAP Resources.
