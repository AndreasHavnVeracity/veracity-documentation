# Enable scheduled refresh on report to get fresh data

To learn more about the Refresh Schedule Plan, go [here](../admin-tab/resource.md).

When a scheduled refresh is set on the data in VAP, fresh data from the report is shown at the intervals you have set. 

**Note that** a scheduled refresh will fail if:
* The file does not have the same file structure as before.
* The access key is no longer valid.
* The file was deleted, or the newly uploaded file does not have the same name.

Enable scheduled refresh or demand refresh on your report.
