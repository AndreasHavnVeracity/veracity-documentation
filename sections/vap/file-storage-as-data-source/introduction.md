# Using Veracity Data Workbench File storage as a data source for Power BI


You can use data from your Veracity Data Workbench File storage in the Power BI report which you upload in VAP. To do it, follow this step-by-step guide made by the VAP team.


The guide will take you through the following steps.
1. Create a Power BI report using Data Workbench File storage. In this part, you will also learn how to update data in Data Workbench and refresh file to get new data in VAP, upload a Power BI file in VAP, and enable a scheduled refresh on report to get fresh data.
2. Optionally, if your Power BI file was connected to Data Fabric, connect it to Data Workbench File storage.
