# Veracity adapter for Power BI

## Overview

Veracity Adapter for Power BI (VAP) allows sharing Power BI reports with your users without requiring them to purchase a Power BI licence and install the software. The only step your users need to take is to sign in to Veracity. The VAP service is hosted and maintaned by Veracity, so that you can focus on the content.

The Veracity Adapter for Power offers:
* Convenient access for end-users. Sign in to Veracity and access the reports that are automatically updated.
* Secure sharing of your reports, interactive dashboards, and other data.
* Managing your reports, users, and their access permissions.
* Maintenance and updates handled by Veracity.
* Easy scaling.
* Optionally, a Marketplace page for monetising your data and reports.

For details about the service, see the [VAP Marketplace page](https://store.veracity.com/veracity-adapter-for-power-bi-vap).
