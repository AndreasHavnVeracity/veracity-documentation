# VAP 4.24 release

Read this page to learn what has changed in the Veracity Adapter for Power BI.

## New features

### Improved error messages and faster support
We are giving you better error messages:
- When an error occurs, you’ll now see a unique **error ID** and additional details.
- **Copy the error ID and details** and include them in your support case for a quicker resolution.

These changes minimize back-and-forth with the support team and help developers identify and fix problems more efficiently.
