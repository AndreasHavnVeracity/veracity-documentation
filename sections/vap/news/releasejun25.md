## New features

### Improved error messages and faster support
We are giving you better error messages:
- **New error codes** are now shown when something goes wrong.  
- **Click “Details”** to view the full error message and code.  
- **Copy and include the error code** in your support ticket for quicker issue resolution.

These changes minimize back-and-forth with the support team and help developers identify and fix problems more efficiently.
