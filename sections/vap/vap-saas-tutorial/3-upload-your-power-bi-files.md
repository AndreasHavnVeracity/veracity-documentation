Every section of this tutorial onwards consists of two main partsâ€”one explaining the details of each feature covered, and one part being step-by-step guid. If you complete the whole tutorial, you will end up with both a fundamental understanding of the feature set and a fully functional VAP service example that you may play around with, and use as a template for you to set up your projects.

We will now start by looking at the <i>Manage Files</i> feature, and explain all the bits and pieces.

## Manage files
The Manage Files section is all about loading your local files into the VAP solution. In most cases, this is where you start, as most other feature depends on the existence of these files. The file types supported are Power BI files (.pbix), PDF's and some image files (.png .jpeg and .gif).
