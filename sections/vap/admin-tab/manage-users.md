## Manage Users

You can only add Veracity users to a VAP entity. However, if you try to add a non-Veracity user, you will be offered an option to invite them to Veracity. To get access to the VAP entity, this person needs to accept the invitation and create their Veracity account.

To add a user to an entity:
1. Select the **Add User** button.
2. Provide the user's email address, and select the **Check Email / User ID** button.
3. In the **Grant access to** dropdown, select the entity to which the user should be added.
4. In the **Roles** dropdown, assign a [role](userroles.md) to the user.
5. Optionally, deselect "Send notification to this user" if you do not want to notify the user that they have been added to an entity in VAP.

To batch add users to an entity:
1. Select the **Batch Add Users** button.
2. In the **Grant access to** dropdown, select the entity to which the users should be added.
3. In the **Roles** dropdown, assign a [role](userroles.md) to the users.
4. Select the **Choose File** button and choose a CSV file from your local machine to batch import users.

If you need a template for batch importing users, you can find it below the **Choose File** button.

The "Manage Users" page shows all users in your VAP service. You can:
* Filter each column providing the text to filter by or choosing an option from a dropdown. To clear all the filters, select the **Clear** button in the right corner of the row with the filters.
* Sort the "Name" and "Email" columns by selecting them.
