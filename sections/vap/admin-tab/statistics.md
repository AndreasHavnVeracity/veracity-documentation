# Statistics

The "Background jobs" page is divided into two tabs:
* Report Statistics - Show usage statistics for reports.
* Entity Statistics - Show usage statistics for entities.

To change the time period for which you are seeing the statistics, under the tab's name, select **Statistics Time** and then select the desired value. Fore example, 6M for six months.

 The reports and entities are listed in a table on the left. To change for which report or entity you are viewing statistics, select another report or entity from the table.
