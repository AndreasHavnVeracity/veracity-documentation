# Manage Entities

An entity:
* Can contain one or more reports.
* You share access to end users to one or more entities.
* Is a way of groping and structuring your reports.
* Represents the top-level concepts such as company, projects or assets.

To add an entity:
1. Select the **Add** button.
2. In the **Title**, provide the internal name of the entity. It will be shown only to admin users. By default, the title will be used to create the URL for the entity.
3. Optionally, deselect the toggle **Use Title as Entity URL Name** and then in the **Entity URL name** field provide a custom URL for the entity. The URL name must be unique and cannot contain spaces or special characters. You can use alphanumeric values, underscore, and hyphen.
4. In the **Type** dropdown, select the type of the entity you want to create. If you want users to be able to add themselves to the entity, select **Allow Self Subscribe**; this might be suitable for a demo. If you want users to access the entity wihout login to Veracity, select **Public View**; this might be suitable for a freemium model.
5. In the **Reports** dropdown, select one or more reports that should be available to the users who are part of the entity you are creating.
6. In the right corner, select the **Add** button.

The "Manage Entities" page shows all entities created in your VAP service. To sort them by a specific column, select the column. 

In the right corner of each row, you can:
* Add an icon for the entity.
* See history.
* Edit the entity and see its ID.
* Delete the entity.

The actions above are listed from the first to the last icon from the left.
