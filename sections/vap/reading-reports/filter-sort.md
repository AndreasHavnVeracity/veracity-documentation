# Filtering and sorting

When you open a Power BI report in VAP, you can use filtering and sorting if the report's author configured it.

Note that:
* The available filtering and sorting options come from Power BI.
* Slicers are report elements that are a type of canvas visual filters. For details, see the [Power BI documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/visuals/power-bi-visualization-slicers).

## Showing filtering and sorting

When you hover over a visual element in a report, in its top right corner, VAP shows icons with the available options:
* See what filters and slicers are applied to this element.
* Apply a filter. This icon is shown only if the element has a filter you can apply.
* Focus mode. This enlarges the window with the report element.
* More options.

The icons above are listed from the first to the last icon from the left.

More options, when selected, expand to:
* "Show as table" - shows the element as a table. In the top right corner, shows the filter icon, the "Switch to vertical layout" icon, and the "More options" icon that may show the actions described below.
* "Spotlight" - dims other report elements.
* "Get insights" - shows the analytics for the report element.
* "Sort descending" - sorts values from the highest to the lowest one.
* "Sort ascending" - sort values from the lowest to the highest one.
* "Sort by" - sorts by the selected element (for example, a column).

Note that the sorting and filtering options are configured by the report author and because of that you may see less or more options than described here.

## To apply filters from the filters pane

If the report has a filters pane, to apply filters to the report:
1. In the right corner of the window, select the **Filters** pane.
2. Select the filter(s) you want to use and its settings (if any).
3. In the right bottom corner of the filter window, select **Apply filter**.

## To clear a filter from the filters pane

If the report has a filters pane, to clear a filter from the report:
1. In the right corner of the window, select the **Filters** pane.
2. Select the filter(s) you want to clear.
3. In the top right corner of the filter window, select the eraser icon to clear a filter.
