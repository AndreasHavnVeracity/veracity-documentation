# Bookmarks

Admin users can enable personal and report bookmarks that work like links to the parts of the report they were created on, and can be shared with other users. If you are an admin user, go [here](../admin-tab/manage-reports.md#enable-bookmarks) for details.

Report bookmarks:
* Are created by the report author.
* Are available to all report users.
* Can be deleted only by administrator users with the "Manage Reports" permission.

Personal bookmarks:

* Are availalbe only to their authors and the users with whom they have been shared.
* Can be deleted by their authors.
