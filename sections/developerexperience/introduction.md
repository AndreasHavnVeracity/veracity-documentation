# To create a service in Veracity

To create a service on Veracity platform:
1. Create a Veracity account.
2. From the top navigation bar, select **My projects**. 
3. Create a project.
4. Optionally, invite collaborators and assign access rights.
5. Create a resource group.
6. Create a resource or ask [the onboarding team](mailto:onboarding@veracity.com) to provision it.

If you plan to go to production with your service or application, also go through [the onboarding process](https://developer.veracity.com/docs/section/onboarding/onboarding).

## What is a project, resource group, and resource

A project is used for organizing your resource groups. Typically, you use one project per product. You can add collaborators into a project, and assign them access rights.

A resource group is a container used for organizing your resources. A resource group is labeled with the environment in which it is located ("devtest", "test", "staging" or "production").

A resource is any platform capability that needs provisioning for your project to use it. For example, application credentials.
