Title: Service API
Author: "Brede BÃ¸rhaug"

# Overview 

The Service API provides a consistent interface for accessing data about the user and the Veracity platform in general. At its heart it is a REST service built up of "view-points" where you can read, write and update information. Authentication is handled through Azure B2C OAuth 2.

## Authentication

Authentication is performed through OAuth2 bearer tokens.

## View-points

The API defines three primary view-points from which you can access more detailed information. The base url for requests is:

***[TODO NOT VERIFIED FINAL URLS]***
```url
https://myapiv3.dnvgl.com/[view-point]

e.g.:
https://myapiv3.dnvgl.com/my/profile
```

These are:

|View-point|Path|Description|
|:---------|:-------|:----------|
|Discover|`/discover`|Information about different masterdata and resources with in myDNVGL. The main categories are: Services, Users and companies.|
|My|`/my`|Provides information about the currently logged in user.|
|This|`/this`|Provides information from the service or applications point of view, its capabilities and metadata.|

The view-points themselves do not provide information directly, instead you interact with them through defined **actions**. An action is just a string that you append to the end of the view-point path in order to perform a request. The actions follow normal usage of HTTP verbs with some minor exceptions.

### Responses

Each response provides all or most of these headers:

|Header|Type|Description|
|:-----|:--:|:----------|
|x-supportcode|GUID|Provides a unified way of correlating log entries accross all system components.|
|x-serviceversion|string|The api build number.|
|x-timer|int|The time spent on the server producing the response in milliseconds. [TODO is this correct?]|
|x-region|string|The Azure service region serving the request.|
|x-principal|-|The user the request was executed on behalf of.|
|x-view-point|string|The name of the current view-point.|
|x-actor|GUID|The user id of the actor/service account. [TODO describe better]|

The response status code describes whether the request succeeded or not. Currently the following status codes may be returned

|HTTP Status|Name|Description|
|:----------|:---|:----------|
|200|OK|Your request was processed correctly. View content for response.|
|204|No Content|Your request was processed correctly and no content was returned.|
|300|Ambiguous|Your request could point to multiple resources. You should augment it with additional identifying information.|
|400|Bad Request|The view-point/action exists, but the way you formatted the request was incorrect. Check `http verb`, `headers` or `body`.|
|403|Forbidden|The requester has insufficient permissions to perform the action or authorization information is missing from the request. Check that you provide a valid OAuth2 `Authorization` header.|
|404|Not Found|The requested resource/view-point/action was not found or is not known.|
|500|Internal Server Error|Something went wrong on the server when processing your request. Try to include the `x-supportcode` header content if you wish to submit a support request.|
|501|Not Implemented|The view-point or action is not currently implemented, but may be in the future.|

#### Response format

The API supports formatting the response body according to the mime type provided in your requests `Accept` header. Currently the following mime types are supported:

- `application/json`
- `text/json`
- `application/xml`
- `text/xml`

### Discover

The primary purpose of the **Discover** view-point is to provide information about your "surroundings". Using it you can get information about companies, services and users in the system. [TODO correct?]

#### Actions

The following actions are supported on the `/discover` view-point. Parameters in urls are indicated by `{}` and should be replaced when using the action.
