# Tutorial

## Data Science Virtual Machine 
To get started with analytics real fast, a good option can be to create a Virtual Machine in Azure. To simplify that process for you we have created two nice buttons for you. Pick your favourite:


Linux: [![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FVeracity%2Fveracity-quickstart-samples%2Fmaster%2F101-data-science-virtual-machine%2Fdata-science-virtual-machine-Linux%2Fdeployazure.json)

Windows: [![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FVeracity%2Fveracity-quickstart-samples%2Fmaster%2F101-data-science-virtual-machine%2Fdata-science-virtual-machine-Windows%2Fdeployazure.json)

The virtual machines come preinstalled with the following nice tools for you:
- Microsoft R Server 9.1 with Microsoft R Open 3.3.3
- Anaconda Python 2.7 and 3.5
- JupyterHub with sample notebooks
- Apache Drill for querying non-relational data using SQL
- Spark local 2.1.1 with PySpark and SparkR Jupyter kernels
- Single node local Hadoop (HDFS, Yarn)
- Azure command-line interface
- Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and Atom
- JuliaPro, a curated distribution of Julia Language and tools
- Vowpal Wabbit for online learning
- xgboost for gradient boosting
