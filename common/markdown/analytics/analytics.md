# Overview

Veracity Data Platform bring people with data close to those who can help bring knowledge and value out of those data. In this section you can read about some tools you can use to do analytics on data. In the tutorial section you will be able to follow comprehensive guides from A to Z on how to do this.



# Tutorial

## Data Science Virtual Machine 
To get started with analytics real fast, a good option can be to create a Virtual Machine in Azure. To simplify that process for you we have created two nice buttons for you. Pick your favourite:


Linux (Ubuntu): [![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FVeracity%2Fveracity-quickstart-samples%2Fmaster%2F101-data-science-virtual-machine%2Fdata-science-virtual-machine-Linux%2Fdeployazure.json)

Windows 2016: [![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FVeracity%2Fveracity-quickstart-samples%2Fmaster%2F101-data-science-virtual-machine%2Fdata-science-virtual-machine-Windows%2Fdeployazure.json)


### Data Science Virtual Machine Linux (Ubuntu)
The Data Science VM's come bundled with lots of nice tools preinstalled for you. The highlights are:

- Microsoft R Server 9.1 with Microsoft R Open 3.3.3
- Anaconda Python 2.7 and 3.5
- JupyterHub with sample notebooks
- Apache Drill for querying non-relational data using SQL
- Spark local 2.1.1 with PySpark and SparkR Jupyter kernels
- Single node local Hadoop (HDFS, Yarn)
- Azure command-line interface
- Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and Atom
- JuliaPro, a curated distribution of Julia Language and tools
- Vowpal Wabbit for online learning
- xgboost for gradient boosting
