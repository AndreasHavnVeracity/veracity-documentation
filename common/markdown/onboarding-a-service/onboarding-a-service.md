## Overview

Veracity is an open, neutral, platform that allows services to be offered by both internal and external providers. There is no need for a direct affiliation with DNV GL, however there is an integration process which has mandatory requirements to ensure the quality of product and service provided.

To get started you need to know about:
1. [How to integrate with our identity provider](https://developer.veracity.com/doc/identity)
2. [How to best present your product on the Marketplace](#how-to-best-present-your-product-in-the-marketplace)
3. [How the Veracity data fabric works](#veracity-data-fabric)

In addition to exploring this documentation, you will need to contact the Veracity team to start the onboarding process.

## Marketplace
Marketplace allows purchases to be made by businesses and authorised individual users only. Purchases can be made via a registered Veracity account or by guests, if sufficient mandatory information is provided. Registering a Veracity account offers the convenience that credentials can be stored for future purchases. Both digital services and data can be sold through the Marketplace. 

Purchases are made via the Veracity E-commerce solution, which is an integrated part of the Marketplace.

### How to best present your product in the Marketplace
Your product's blurb on the marketplace is your primary salespitch towards 100,000+ Veracity users. Veracity will take care of presenting your information, but you will need to provide the text, images, links and optional videos. Your product will be presented in the following way:

1. **Product/Service name** The name of the product/service.
2. **Product/Service main image** The main image for the product/service. The picture should be provided in 1200x300px. 
3. **Product baseline** State the main purpose of the product i.e. what the product/service is for. State the solution and not the problem.
4. **Link to video** Provide the link to a video, this is optional.
5. **3 key benefits** Write about the product i.e. what problem(s) the product solves. 
6. **Price** What it says on the tin, the price of the product including different pricing models e.g. €10,000 per year, €1,500 per month. Different prices will be presented in a list format.

7. **Themed paragraph with title.** One paragraph should describe one theme/subject at a time. If you want to talk about different themes, create a dedicated paragraph for each. Each paragraph has a maximum of 550 characters (including whitespace).
8. **Themed paragraph picture** Use a picture that is relevant regarding the subject explored. It can be a photo or a graphic and can also be a link to a video. The picture should be provided in 530x310px

## Veracity data fabric
The data sharing and data analytics part of Veracity is currently in a private preview phase, meaning that we will work together with a selection of leading customers and providers. We will verify the design and functionality of these elements of the platform, and explore how value can best be created for asset owners and analytic providers. More functionality, services, and providers will be added based on feedback from our private preview phase.

If you are interested in joining this private preview phase, please reach out to your current DNV GL business contact and we will carefully assess if we can on-board you now.

Feel free to start investigating the documentation on the [data fabric API](https://developer.veracity.com/doc/data-fabric-api), [data fabric in general](https://developer.veracity.com/docs), and sample code on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/veracity) to get a feeling for what opportunities the data fabric enables.
