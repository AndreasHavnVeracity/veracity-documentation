## Overview

## Veracity data fabric
The data sharing and data analytics part of Veracity is currently in a private preview phase, meaning that we will work together with a selection of leading customers and providers. We will verify the design and functionality of these elements of the platform, and explore how value can be best created for asset owners and analytic providers. More functionality, services, and providers will be added based on feedback from our private preview customers and providers.

If you are interested in joining this private preview phase please reach out to your current DNV GL business contact and we will carefully assess if we can on-board you already now.
