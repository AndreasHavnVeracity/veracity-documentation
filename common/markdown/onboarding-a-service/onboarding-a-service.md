# Overview

Veracity is an open neutral platform that will allow services to be offered by both internal and external providers. There is no need for a direct affiliation with DNVGL, however there is an integration process which will have mandatory requirements to ensure quality of product and service provided.

Marketplace allows purchases to be made by businesses and authorised individual users only. Purchases can be made via a registered Veracity account or by guests if sufficient mandatory information is provided. Registering a Veracity account can offer convience of purchase in the future as credentials can be stored. 

Purchases can be made via electronic invoice and in the near future it will be possible to make purchases using credit card.

# Veracity the right place for your

It is no secret that a service will perform better when complemented by the right platform and vice versa. Veracity intends to facilitate services that meet customers expectations, both in quality of the service and focus of segment. We have put together a self-assessment tool that you should complete if you are planing to onboard as a service provider. The purpose of this self-assessment is to create a profile of the proposal, enabling a smoother onboarding process.

Link to self assesment will soon be awailable at this site.
