## Overview

Veracity is an open neutral platform that will allow services to be offered by both internal and external providers. There is no need for a direct affiliation with DNVGL, however there is an integration process which will have mandatory requirements to ensure quality of product and service provided.

To get started you need to know about:
1. How to do integration towards our identity provider
2. How to best present your product in the Marketplace
3. How the Veracity data fabric work
4. 

## Marketplace
Marketplace allows purchases to be made by businesses and authorised individual users only. Purchases can be made via a registered Veracity account or by guests if sufficient mandatory information is provided. Registering a Veracity account can offer convience of purchase in the future as credentials can be stored.

Purchases are made via the Veracity E-comerce solution, which is an integrated part of the Marketplace.


## Veracity data fabric
The data sharing and data analytics part of Veracity is currently in a private preview phase, meaning that we will work together with a selection of leading customers and providers. We will verify the design and functionality of these elements of the platform, and explore how value can be best created for asset owners and analytic providers. More functionality, services, and providers will be added based on feedback from our private preview customers and providers.

If you are interested in joining this private preview phase please reach out to your current DNV GL business contact and we will carefully assess if we can on-board you already now.
