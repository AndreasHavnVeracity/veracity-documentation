# Veracity the right place for your

It is no secret that a service will perform better when complemented by the right platform and vice versa. Veracity intends to facilitate services that meet customers expectations, both in quality of the service and focus of segment. We have put together a self-assessment tool that you should complete if you are planing to onboard as a service provider. The purpose of this self-assessment is to create a profile of the proposal, enabling a smoother onboarding process.
