# Overview 
Veracity Storage Containers are allowing you to store unstructured data at a massive scale in block blobs. There are no limitations to what type of unstructured data you may store, and you may also dump database files into the storage for sharing. You may store images, video, audio or timeseries. Your stored data can then easily be shared with others for data analysis eather in the cloud or on-premises at the service provider.
