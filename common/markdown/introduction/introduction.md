## Welcome to Veracity for Developers


Veracity is designed to help companies unlock, qualify, combine and prepare data for analytics and benchmarking. We want to help our customers leverage the ever-increasing amount of data they own. 
On the platform’s marketplace, asset owners will get access to industrial applications and data analytics services that can help them make better use of their data to optimize their performance. These apps will be provided not only by DNV GL, but by many other qualified providers of data, data analytics and digital solutions as well. Veracity for Developers is designed to support both the IT pros and developers at the data provider side, and the developer, data analysts and IT Ppros at the data consumer side.

### Where do I start?
With all the new opportunities Veracity enables for both asset owners and service providers, it can be a daunting task to figure out which services you need to support in your solution architecture. Here are some quickk tips and links.

- **How do I create a service on veracity** : We are happy to start working with 3. party providers to onboard new services. Some back office work is still required in the process, but start reading up in the [onboarding a service](https://developer.veracity.com/doc/onboarding-a-service) documentation and reach out to the Veracity team.
- **Can anybody sell a service or data in the marketplace?** Yes! Veracity is an open B2B platform, and we allow both complimentary services and competing services on to the platform. 
- **How do we get payed when selling a product on Veracity?** We provide an E-Comerce solution in cooperation with Oracle, where you get payed through Veracity.
- **Where can I find code samples to get started?** All code samples are open source, and on our [GitHub](https://www.github.com/Veracity) account. Fork our reposotories and follow the tutorials in the documentation [here](https://developer.veracity.com/docs) on Veracity for developers.  
- **How can i test out the [data fabric](#data-fabric-private-preview)?** The data sharing and data analytics part of Veracity is currently in a private preview phase, meaning that we will work together with a selection of leading customers and providers. We will verify the design and functionality of these elements of the platform, and explore how value can be best created for asset owners and analytic providers. If you are interested in joining this private preview phase please reach out to your current DNV GL business contact and we will carefully assess if we can on-board you already now.
- **Is there a Veracity developer program?** The Veracity developer program will be anounced in the near future.
- **I want to contribute open source** : Great! We embrace open source, and feel free to do a pull request on any of our public repos. Please read the contributor guidelines in the reposotories on GitHub. We do not only share open source, but do also contribute with developers. We have some projects already on GitHub. Feel free to join.



### Veracity high-level architecture
Veracoty consist of multiple main components. The marketplace and my services, with accompanying API enable you to create, merket and sell services or data, together with a E-commerce solution. Further Veracity have the Veracity data fabric, which enable you to share and combine data in a trusted eco-system. The Veracity data fabric is built in partnership with Microsoft Azure, and supplemented by key partners in the industry, enabling Big Data capability on a global scale. 

#### Marketplace
The Marketplace within Veracity is an Oracle based E-Commerce solution which allows external customers to browse, enquire and purchase digital services that are offered by both DNV GL and external providers. Veracity is an open neutral platform, and for that reason we will allow services to be offered by both internal and external providers. There is no need for a direct affiliation with DNV GL , however there is an integration process which has mandatory requirements to ensure the quality of product and service provided. To get going with this process, please reach out to Veracity team and we will help you get started. Also check out the [Onboarding a Service](https://developer.veracity.com/doc/onboarding-a-service) documentation for more technical detail.

#### Data fabric - private preview
The data sharing and data analytics part of Veracity is currently in a private preview phase, meaning that we will work together with a selection of leading customers and providers. We will verify the design and functionality of these elements of the platform, and explore how value can be best created for asset owners and analytic providers. 

More functionality, services, and providers will be added based on feedback from our private preview customers and providers. You may investigate the code samples and documentation related to the data fabric, and feel free to reach out to the Veracity team for additional questions.
